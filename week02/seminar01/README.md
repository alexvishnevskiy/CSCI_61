## Queue
----

### Functions
* enqueue to put
* deque to output
* front to pop
* size()
* empty()

### two ways to implement :
1) using an array
2) using a linked list

**For linked list:**
It is easier to remove from head, so the front of queue in linked list is head and back is tail.

**For array:**
Structure is like circular array. If size exceeds capacity it goes cyclic.
